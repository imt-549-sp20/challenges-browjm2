# Final-Project

## Brown Family Recipes

### What is the Content of This Project?

The project consists of a collection of some of the Brown Family's favorite recipes. Some are new and some have been passed down for generations.

### What Was The Inspiration For This Project?

Our family uses several recipes obtained from our various cookbooks, internet favorites, and the print version of our family cookbook. Finding the recipes for a single meal might require us to search multiple sources. This project came about through a desire to locate all of our favorite recipes in one place.
